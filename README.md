ristrettolo.gy
==============

This is one of the two repositories responsible for the site [ristrettolo.gy]. It's a static site hosted on [Github Pages] that is built with [Jekyll], it contains the text of my book [CoffeeScript Ristretto](https://leanpub.com/coffeescript-ristretto).

[Leanpub] books are written as collections of markdown files and images, with a manifest to organize everything. These are used to generate the ebooks, and there is also a feature to export a .html file. I exported the file, choosing not to wrap it in html and body tags, and also choosing to have the entire book in one file rather than one file per chapter. That file is dropped into `_includes`, and the exported images are dropped into the root. 

The rest of this repository is set up to create a web site that includes a "speed bump" feature: When a user scrolls approximately half-way through the book, a modal dialog appears politely suggesting that the user buy the ebook. The dialog can be dismissed to continue reading.

The "speed bump" is coded in CoffeeScript and makes use of Underscore, jQuery, and jQuery SimpleModal. Because it uses the [Jekyll Asset Pipeline][jap] to transpile CoffeeScript into JavaScript, building the site is a little more involved than a typical Jekyll-on-Github-Pages site.

I'm assuming that you want to try it for either of two reasons:

1. You're nice enough to have noticed a bug, typo, or potential improvement and want to send a pull request, or;
2. You're copying the setup for your own site.

Either way, here's how it works:

background reading
------------------

* [Github Pages Help](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles)
* [Using Jekyll with Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)
* [The Jekyll Asset Pipeline][jap]
* [Jekyll + Plugins + Github + You](http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/)

In a nutshell, Github Pages publishes your static site by running it through Jekyll. Since every html page is a valid Jekyll page, Github Pages looks just like a static web server. But if you set up your repo to take advantage of Jekyll's features like [Liquid Templates], Github Pages will do the processing on the server side when you push to the server.

[Liquid Templates]: http://liquidmarkup.org

This means that any local use of Jekyll doesn't actually affect what's served from Github, it's just for your own preview and testing purposes. This matters greatly, because Github Pages is always in `safe` mode, meaning that it will not run plugins, at all.

Meaning, it will not convert CoffeeScript using the asset pipeline plugin or the CoffeeScript conversion plugin. Thus, we work around it.

setup
-----

First, clone the source repository, [raganwald/ristrettolo.gy][rr] to your local system (cloning [ristrettolo-gy/ristrettolo-gy.github.com][rrgc] is not helpful). You will also need Ruby, and [Bundler] and you're going to run `bundle install`. Or, you're going to use `gem install` for each of the gems in the Gemfile.

[Bundler]: http://gembundler.com
[rr]: https://github.com/raganwald/ristrettolo.gy
[rrgc]: https://github.com/ristrettolo-gy/ristrettolo-gy.github.com

If you wish to make changes and/or send me a pull request, you can stop right here. Run `jekyll` to process the site locally. Run `jekyll --auto` to automagically process the site when you edit things locally. Run `jekyll --server 3210` to run a local server on your favourite port, like `3210`.

hosting your own site
---------------------

You can use this to host your own site on a server. Clone this repo, then modify `index.md` to suit your needs. If you're using Leanpub, export your book as a single .html page and put it in `_includes`. I renamed it `coffeescript-ristretto.html`, but you don't have to rename it. Just be sure to adjust the include markup accordingly. You may also want to fiddle extensively with the styles. Finally, modify `speed-bump.html` to taste.

When you're happy with the contents of `_site`, push them to your server using your favourite method of transferring the files, such as `sftp`.

pushing to github pages
-----------------------

If you want to host your own site on Github Pages, you need to have a *separate* repository set up (You can't use [ristrettolo-gy/ristrettolo-gy.github.com][rrgc], that's my site!). We'll call your copy of [raganwald/ristrettolo.gy][rr] the `source` repo and we'll call the new one the `published` repo.

When you're happy with the `source` repo, you'll need to copy all of the files (recursively!) from `source/_site` into `published/`: `assets`, `index.html`, `CNAME`, the whole shebang. Then you'll need to commit and push. It's now a static site with no plugins, and Github Pages will publish it nicely for you.

You're a programmer, so you're probably already googling for a bash script to do it for you (why create when you can sit back and consume copypasta?) Here's my exact `~/.bash_profile` entries, snarfed as-is from [Jekyll + Plugins + Github + You](http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/):

```bash
alias build_blog="cd ~/Dropbox/sites/ristrettolo.gy.raw; jekyll;cp -r ~/Dropbox/sites/ristrettolo.gy.raw/_site/* ~/Dropbox/sites/ristrettolo-gy.github.com;cd ~/Dropbox/sites/ristrettolo-gy.github.com;git add .;git commit -am 'Latest build.';git push"
alias bb="build_blog"
```

the speed bump
--------------

You might not like the speed bump, or want to experiment with other ways of displaying it. The code currently supports the option of not showing the speed bump, and also the option of not "obfuscating" the second half of the book until you dismiss the speed bump.

That's it!

p.s. If your publishing gets really complex, you could use Capistrano to deploy. But a one-line bash script is all I need, so that's what I use.
